          <p>As soon as I entered high school, I started working in the restaurant and I thought that restaurant would be industry that I would be working for the rest of my life. From there, I learned the fundamentals of culinary arts and passion for all things related to culinary arts emegerd within me. I have always dreamed of owning a retaurant one day until I graduated from high school in 2020.
            <br><br>
          It was at that time, my older sister introduced me to the internship i.c.stars. i.c.stars is program that trains the technology, leadership, and business skills for underderserved young adults. She passionately talked about all the good things about the program from what she has been doing and what she has gained after completing the program. As a brother I knew what my sister had been through before joinning the program, I was very proud of what she has gained from this experience. This interested me to get into the program and I immediately decided to apply join the i.c.stars in the summer of 2021.</p>
